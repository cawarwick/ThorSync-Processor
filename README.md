# ThorSync-Processor
This script will intake the .H5 files from ThorSync and downsample them to the desired rate, then filter them by whichever datafiles you want to keep, and then saving them either to a single CSV per .h5 file or a merged csv.

I haven't flesh it out particularly fully as to whether it'll be standalone or integrated with the main Calcium Imaging repo, but at least it's here.
